## makeHero

### Project Notes
  - MakeHero is a simple web app that allows the user to choose their hero and select their attributes
    - Hero choices: Gladiator, Ninja, or Samurai
  - Created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  - To ADD/SUBTRACT stats, you can use the round buttons that are adjacent to the stat bars.
  - If you click on the actual stat bars, you are able to ADD stats with Left mouse click, and SUBTRACT stats with Right mouse click
  - For stat bar manipulation, the CSS background-color is changed on each click to be added or subtracted in increments of 3%
  - Hide/Show heros depending on which hero class is selected. Style => display set to none if it is not a selected class.

### Future Updates 
   - Add more hero classes to choose from
   - Different color choices for each hero's outfit
   - Responsive design, media queries for different image sizes to create a mobile-first application that scales all the way up to PC
   - Redesign page to include a section for assigning a hero name, gender, things like that.
